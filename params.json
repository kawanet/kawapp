No special classes or objects other than Kawapp are required.\r\n  This uses a plain object to manage request context (locals).\r\n  This uses a jQuery object to draw a response content, on the other hand.\r\n  jQuery is not required, in fact, as Kawapp includes a mini-subset of jQuery.\r\n\r\n* a framework which run on browser environments, of course.\r\n\r\n* a framework which run on node.js environment.\r\n  This means your same code could run on both side of server and client.\r\n  Thin jQuery clone [Cheerio](https://npmjs.org/package/cheerio) is also\r\n  available to run this on node.js.\r\n\r\n* test ready.\r\n  Node.js's test frameworks would help you to develop client applications as well.\r\n\r\n* super light-weight. Minified version of this only take 3KB.\r\n\r\n## Kawapp is NOT...\r\n\r\n* a template engine. Use great template engines such as\r\n  [Hogan.js](http://twitter.github.io/hogan.js/),\r\n  [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com), etc.\r\n  Kawapp works great with those third party template engines.\r\n\r\n* a HTTP server. Use [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) as usual.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\n* https://raw.github.com/kawanet/kawapp/master/kawapp.js -\r\n  source\r\n\r\n* https://raw.github.com/kawanet/kawapp/master/dist/kawapp.min.js -\r\n  minified (3KB)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n\"Kyukou\" means \"Express\" in Japanese.\r\n\r\n## MIT Licence\r\n\r\nCopyright 2014 @kawanet Yusuke Kawasaki\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
